# Name: locate_nearby_rss_j_minus.R
# Description: This script is designed to detect which rss are detected in the vecinity of a exon or gene sequence.
# This is achieved by increasing the range of exon or gene both at the 5' and 3' ends of V segments, and then trying to make an overlap,
# with the detected RSS sequences from nhmmer fro V segments.
# The coordinates of overlapping V segment and RSS are mutualy corrected.
